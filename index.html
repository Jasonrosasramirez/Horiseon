. Remember that # searches for unique IDs in HTML. 
. The header section hreferences the ID within this sheet of code.   
. Use semantics to define meaning for different sections of a webpage. 
. Remember to update the CSS if you are going to change class types and IDs. 
. alt in a text displays alternate text in case the image in not uploaded for some reason. 
    alt is also useful for those who have trouble seeing. 
    Adding alts wherever possible
